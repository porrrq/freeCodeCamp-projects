# Tribute Page

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to [FreeCodeCamp Tribute Page](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks). **Do not copy this demo project.**

---

## User Stories

1. **Main Content**
    - Your tribute page should have a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main"`, which contains all other elements.
  
2. **Title**
    - You should see an element with an `id="title"`, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g., "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

3. **Image Section**
    - You should see either a `figure` or a `div` element with an `id="img-div"`.
    - Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an `img` element with a corresponding `id="image"`.
    - Within the `#img-div` element, you should see an element with a corresponding `id="img-caption"` that contains textual content describing the image shown in `#img-div`.

4. **Tribute Information**
    - You should see an element with a corresponding `id="tribute-info"`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

5. **External Link**
    - You should see an `a` element with a corresponding `id="tribute-link"`, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
    - **Hint**: You must give your element an attribute of `target` and set it to `_blank` in order for your link to open in a new tab.

6. **Image Responsiveness**
    - Your `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
    - Your `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
