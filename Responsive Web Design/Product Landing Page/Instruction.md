## User Stories

1. **Header**
    - Your product landing page should have a `header` element with a corresponding `id="header"`.
    - You should see an image within the `header` element with a corresponding `id="header-img"` (A logo would make a good image here).
    - Within the `#header` element, you should see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="nav-bar"`.

2. **Navigation**
    - You can see at least three clickable elements inside the `nav` element, each with the class `nav-link`.
    - When you click a `.nav-link` button in the `nav` element, you should be taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

3. **Embedded Video**
    - You should be able to watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.

4. **Form**
    - Your landing page should have a `form` element with a corresponding `id="form"`.
    - Within the form, there should be an input field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address.
    - The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.
    - The `#email` input field should use HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
    - Within the form, there should be a submit input with a corresponding `id="submit"`.
    - When you click the `#submit` element, the email should be submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: `https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit`).

5. **Navigation Bar**
    - The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.

6. **Responsiveness**
    - Your product landing page should have at least one media query.

7. **CSS Flexbox**
    - Your product landing page should utilize CSS Flexbox at least once.
